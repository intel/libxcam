Description:
libXCam is a project for extended camera features, especially 3A process.
It separates 3A algorithm and image processors, and makes user defined
algorithm possible. This framework also makes GPU/CPU/ISP joining the image
process.

Features:
  * Image processing features.
    - 3A features
       Auto whitebalance, auto exposure, auto focus, black level correction,
       color correction, 3a-statistics calculation.
    - Basic features
       Gamma correction, MACC, color space, demosaicing, noise reduction,
       edge enhancement.
    - Advanced features
       - Noise reduction: simple bilateral NR, temporal NR, wavelet NR,
         adaptive NR with Bayesian shrinkage, 3D-NR.
       - WDR: gaussian-based tone-mapping, histogram adjustment tone-mapping
       - Fog removal: retinex and dark channel prior algorithm.
       - Blender: multi-band blender and fisheye geometry map correction.
       - Image stiching: feature detect and match to generate panorama photography through multi-frame images captured in adjacent point of view.
       - DVS: digital image stabilization based on feature detect, optical flow and motion model estimation.
  * Capture features support memory type of mmap and dma buffer.
  * Support 3rd party 3A lib which can be loaded dynamically.
       - hybrid 3a plugin
  * Image processing based on both ISP and Open CL.
  * Support 3a analysis tuning framework for different features
  * Support smart analysis framework
       - Face detection interface/plugin
  * Support as gstreamer plugin
       - xcamsrc, capture from usb/isp camera, process 3a/basic/advanced features.
       - xcamfilter, improve image quality by advanced features and smart analysis.
